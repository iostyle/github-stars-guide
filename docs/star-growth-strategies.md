## Strategy Matrix by Project Type

| Project Type | Key Strategy 1 | Key Strategy 2 | Key Strategy 3 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Developer Tools | Live demos | Comprehensive docs | Performance benchmarks |
| Libraries/Frameworks | Easy integration examples | Robust API docs | Ecosystem of plugins |
| Educational Resources | Interactive examples | Learning roadmaps | Community challenges |
| Applications | User testimonials | Feature comparison tables | Regular release cycle |
| Data Science | Benchmark datasets | Research citations | Jupyter notebooks |

## Measuring Success

Don't focus solely on star count. Also track:

- Fork-to-star ratio
- Issue response time
- Community activity metrics
- Adoption indicators
- Contributor growth

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Asking for stars without providing value
- Neglecting documentation
- Slow response to issues and PRs
- Inconsistent maintenance
- Feature bloat
- Breaking changes without migration paths
- Ignoring feedback

## Resources

- Use our [Star Acquisition Checklist](./github-star-checklist-en.md) to evaluate your project
- Track your growth with our [Star Growth Tracker](./star-growth-tracker.md)
- Learn from successful projects in our [Case Studies](./case-studies.md)

Remember that stars are ultimately a reflection of the value your project provides to users. Focus on creating genuine utility and stars will follow as a natural consequence.
