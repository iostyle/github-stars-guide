## Scoring Guide

Calculate how many of the above items your project satisfies:

- **45-50 items**: Star Magnet - Your project has implemented almost all best practices for attracting stars
- **35-44 items**: Star Ready - Your project is on the right track with only minor improvements needed
- **25-34 items**: Promising - Focus on the missing areas, especially basic quality and documentation
- **15-24 items**: Needs Attention - Prioritize basic quality, core documentation, and user experience
- **Less than 15 items**: Major Improvements Needed - Address fundamentals before considering marketing

## Next Steps

1. For unfulfilled checklist items, create issues to track improvement plans
2. Prioritize basic quality and documentation issues, as these are the foundation for earning stars
3. Reassess your project after implementing improvements
4. Remember: Quality and value are the best long-term strategies for earning stars

Remember that this checklist is a guide, not a rulebook. Some projects may not need to satisfy all checklist items due to their nature. Ultimately, creating a genuinely useful project is the fundamental path to earning stars.
